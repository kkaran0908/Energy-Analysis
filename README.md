### Solar Forecasting using Bayesian Linear Regression
1. We are getting almost comparable results to that of Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network along with uncertainity.

# Energy-Analysis
### USS Data
It shows how is the pattern of energy consumption in IIT Gandhinagar. Each excel file contains various parameters such as Voltage, Current, Power, etc.
The Resolution of the data is hourly Means in a day we are going to have 24 readings.

## Insights from USS Data Analysis for Academic Block7
1. Standard deviation in all the field during the covid 19 is less as comapare to the normal college days.
2. During the Normal college time flactuation in voltage is very high as compare to covid 19.
3. We can not say anything about Power and current during the Covid 19 and normal college days.

## Insights from USS Data Analysis for Hostel Area
1. For Hostel area almost all the parameters are constant. There is no flactuation in energy, voltage, power etc.
